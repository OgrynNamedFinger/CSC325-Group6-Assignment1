Ended up trying Copilot this time with the later parts of the assignment as I was curious about how it would handle some of the steps, man does it feel slightly hectic. For a while it ended up with 4 issues in ZooManager, 4 in Bird, 2 in Fish, and 9 in Main, but am I glad to finally have this done. As always if you have any recommendations please let me know, time of finishing this text is 11:27, I am going to bed.
