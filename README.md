I got confused by the AI Reflection part of the submission checklist, unsure if we were supposed to use AI or not, and then if I still needed to do a reflection or not if I wasn't using AI. So I figured I would use AI to assist with the Level 3 segment of the assignment, as the reflection segment asks what did it get wrong in debugging and how did I fix and/or imrpove it.
 I chucked my code into ChatGPT telling it step by step the instructions for Level 3, and boy oh boy did it spit out... something. A tangled mess of comments and code that's what.
It did manage to create the ASCII art splash screen (Man does it make me nostalgic for old Game FAQs) but I cannot help but feel that there is a simplier way to handle the splash screen outside of 6 seperate lines of code... Oh well, WKCTC's java class didn't teach us how to do the splash screens.
 It was nice to see the user prompted inputs section, which I guess was created due to the "Add exception handling for empty names or negative ages" step, and it did give back a loop if there was an empty name stating "Error: Name cannot be empty." Then "Error: Age cannot be negative." for the negative number part, however it still displays an input age of 0 normally which did not go against the given instructions, only stating to add exception handling for "Empty" names and/or "Negative" numbers.
 For an initial trial run, I put my name as Gilligan and age 0, it gave off the results of "Hello Gilligan!" "Good morning, Gilligan!" "Hello, my name is Gilligan and I am 0 years old." However it also gave off two unwanted lines "Hello, Guest!" and "Welcome, Guest!" So, to test the code without possibly destroying the whole thing, I turned the lines with the guests outputs into comments, resulting in a more favorable success of only containing the greetins with the inputed name an/or age.
 To wrap this lengthy text up, I changed the ASCII art splash screen to remove the word demo so it'll read "WELCOME TO JAVA APP HelloWorld."
